This is a concatenated source code file containing multiple source files from a project.
Each file section begins and ends with a delimiter line "---".
After the opening delimiter, there is metadata about the file:
- File: relative path to the source file
- Last commit: Git commit hash of the last change
- Last update: Unix timestamp of the last change

Please analyze the code with these aspects in mind:

2. The overall architecture and design patterns used
3. Any potential improvements or issues you notice
4. Consider the context of changes based on the Git metadata

The code sections follow below:"""
