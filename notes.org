#+title: Notes

* Ideas
** rwlock on database to allow access from other threads.
** DONE probably less storage size for redb would mean better performance, i.e. need to use bitvec
** DONE cli tool (clap)
** DONE TUI (to visualise data)
** DONE backend for redb using redb crate
** TODO https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash - maybe check this hash?
https://docs.rs/twox-hash/latest/twox_hash/
** TODO I think need one meta-hash function
instead of K hash function can use composite hash function which will create K different hashes
using so called 2 hash trick:
```python
def get_hashes(key, k, m):
    h1 = hash1(key)
    h2 = hash2(key)
    for i in range(k):
        yield (h1 + i * h2) % m
```
